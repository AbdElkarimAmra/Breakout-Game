# Breakout Game 🎮
================

A classic arcade game built in Java! This project is a recreation of **Breakout**, where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The goal is to clear all the bricks without losing all three lives.

🛠 Features
-----------
✅ **Ball physics** – The ball bounces off walls, the paddle, and bricks realistically.  
✅ **Interactive paddle** – Moves with mouse input for precise control.  
✅ **Brick-breaking mechanics** – Bricks disappear when hit, and the game ends when all are cleared.  
✅ **Win/Loss conditions** – The player wins when all bricks are gone and loses when all lives are used.  
✅ **Randomized ball launch** – The ball starts at a random angle for varied gameplay.

🎮 How to Play
--------------
1. Run the program to start the game.
2. The ball launches automatically after a short delay.
3. Move the paddle using your mouse to keep the ball in play.
4. Break all the bricks to win! If you miss the ball three times, you lose.

🏗 Technologies Used
--------------------
* **Java** – Core programming language
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Clean and modular design
* **Graphics Library (kilt-graphics or JavaFX, specify if used)** – For rendering game visuals

🚀 Possible Enhancements (Future Work)
--------------------------------------
🔹 Power-ups (e.g., larger paddle, multi-ball)  
🔹 Score tracking and high scores  
🔹 Different brick layouts and levels  
🔹 Sound effects for better game feedback
